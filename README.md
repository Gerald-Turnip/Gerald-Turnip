## Introduction

Sopot, Poland – June 18, 2025 – This report details a series of disturbing events and alleged systemic irregularities within prominent cultural and academic institutions in Gdańsk, Poland. What began as a dispute over a concert has escalated into a comprehensive account of alleged financial impropriety, abuse of power, psychological coercion, and attempts to silence a student and artist. This expose aims to shed light on practices that, if true, undermine the integrity of public benefit organizations and the artistic community in Gdańsk and Tricity.

## 🚨 What Happened

The Concert Controversy: Threats and Alleged Coercion
The genesis of this investigation lies in a planned concert at Oliwski Ratusz Kultury (ORK), a venue operating under the Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska. On May 19, 2025, I made the difficult decision to cancel my scheduled performance due to alleged threats and unreasonable demands made by Andrzej Stańko, the ORK Coordinator of Scenic Events.

According to my reports, Mr. Stańko demanded exclusivity for my concert, threatening a financial penalty exceeding 800 PLN if I did not cancel another performance scheduled in Sopot the day prior. This demand was not part of any prior agreement, nor were the conditions formally presented. Crucially, I allege that Mr. Stańko, despite ORK's public-facing role, attempted to impose private, non-negotiable, and unagreed-upon terms.

Further, I was later presented with additional, undisclosed fees for "acoustic services" by Andrzej. This was despite my performance being a string quintet, rendering such services unnecessary and potentially detrimental to the sound quality, and, quite frankly, the fatc that we had literally never had a discussion on the matter. My independent evidence indicates that my email, sent just two hours prior to Mr. Stańko's public comment, directly contradicts his claim that I had not attempted to contact him. This is a pattern of misinformation I have documented.

# Initial Public Statement: The Catalyst
On May 19, 2025, I made a public statement on Facebook, announcing the cancellation of my concert and outlining the reasons behind my decision. This post served as the catalyst for the subsequent public responses and counter-allegations from the Stańkos, and initiated the formal reporting to various institutions.

KONCERT ODWOŁANY / CONCERT CANCELLED
Z przykrością odwołuję mój koncert w Oliwski Ratusz Kultury (ORK), zaplanowany na 28 czerwca.
Dlaczego? Ponieważ zostałem zagrożony karami finansowymi przekraczającymi 800 zł, jeśli nie odwołam innego koncertu — zaplanowanego dzień wcześniej w Sopocie.
Naprawdę.
Decyzja ta pochodzi od Andrzeja Stańko, Koordynatora Wydarzeń Scenicznych ORK — instytucji finansowanej publicznie, działającej w ramach Fundacji Wspólnota Gdańsk, która rzekomo wspiera kulturę.
Zażądał wyłączności. Nie z powodów artystycznych, tylko dlatego, że „oba miejsca są oddalone o 5 km”.
Zaproponował możliwość zagrania obu koncertów tylko jeśli zrzeknę się prawie całego dochodu z biletów.
To nie jest współpraca. To szantaż.
To zachowanie nie ma miejsca w kulturze.
To nie tylko brak szacunku wobec mnie, ale też wobec młodych muzyków, którzy często grają recitale dyplomowe właśnie w tych salach.
Zgłosiłem ten incydent — wraz ze zrzutami ekranu — do wielu instytucji kultury, wydziałów miejskich i uczelni artystycznych.
Bo mam ZERO TOLERANCJI dla mobbingu, zastraszania i finansowego wymuszania w imię „współpracy”.
Wybieram uczciwość zamiast uległości.
I nie będę wspierał instytucji, które nadużywają swojej pozycji.

# Public Responses and Counter-Allegations
Following my initial public statement regarding the concert cancellation, both Andrzej Stańko and Krystyna Stańko issued public responses that contain claims directly contradicted by documented evidence.

# Andrzej Stańko's Deleted Facebook Comment (May 19, 2025, 11 AM):
Andrzej Stańko publicly commented: "Szanowny Panie, po pierwsze scena Oliwskiego Ratusza Kultury utrzymuje się z biletów, a nie z pieniędzy publicznych. Na Pana koncert sprzedało się 5 biletów! Nie poinformował nas Pan, że zaplanowany jest Pana kolejny koncert w odległości 5km! Dowiedziałem się o tym z internetu, a nie od Pana. Przypominam, że termin Pana koncertu został wpisany do naszego kalendarza 7.11.2024. Aby nie odwoływać koncertu zaproponowałem rozwiązanie, 800 zł, to koszt wynajmu sali z realizatorem dźwięku. Czy to dużo? Nie sądzę. Powinien Pan wiedzieć, że żaden klub, ani instytucja nie zgodzi się na granie 2 koncertów w tak bliskiej odległości w podobnym czasie. Proszę nie siać dezinformacji i nie nastawiać wrogo artystów i publiczności! Używanie takich słów jak: „mobbing, wrogość, ultimatum" są w te sytuacji bezpodstawne. Przykro również, że nie spróbował Pan się ze mną skontaktować i porozmawiać. Oliwski Ratusz Kultury w ramach swojego programu zaprasza artystów także mniej znanych, ale warunek jest jeden, ponieważ nie jest instytucją, która ma dotację na organizację koncertów, muszą się one samofinansować, a przynajmniej nie przynosić strat. Również po to, żeby to miejsce mogło nadal służyć artystom."

# Krystyna Stańko's Facebook Post (Day after my Facebook post):
Krystyna Stańko, responding publicly to the situation, wrote: "Drodzy, jak wiecie zawsze leży mi na sercu dobro młodych artystów. Niejednokrotnie razem z moim mężem Andrzej Stańko wspieraliśmy, pomagaliśmy, wiedząc, jak trudne jest życie muzyka. Robiliśmy to z dobrego serca... Niestety od dwóch dni jeden z młodych muzyków uprawia straszliwy czarny PR, nie wymienię jego nazwiska, bo posty krytykujące mojego męża na stronie tej osoby wreszcie mają zasięgi. Może właśnie o to chodzi, żeby zaistnieć? Gdy mój mąż chciał napisać swój komentarz i wyjaśnić sprawę, został przez niego zablokowany. Ów młody muzyk straszy prokuraturą, twierdzi, że powiadomił instytucje oraz media w mieście itp. Szkaluje dobre imię mojego męża i rozpowszechnia nieprawdziwe treści. Cóż, chciał zagrać dwa koncerty w oddalonych od siebie o 5 km miejscach w bardzo bliskim terminie, o czym mój mąż dowiedział się nie od niego, lecz z internetu. Aby nie odwoływać koncertu, na który sprzedało się bardzo mało biletów, Andrzej Stańko szukał rozwiązania, zaproponował wynajem sali z akustykiem, za symboliczną kwotę 800 zł (!). Czy to dużo? Z pewnością nie, w sumie miał prawo odwołać ten koncert wobec postawy muzyka, który nie poinformował organizatora o planie zagrania kolejnego koncertu tak blisko. Wbrew temu, co udostępnia muzyk, miejsce w którym pracuje mój mąż nie ma dotacji do koncertów i nie jest instytucją miejską. Jestem wstrząśnięta zachowaniem muzyka, w sumie ręce mi opadają, bo zawsze wierzyłam, że tworzymy jakąś wspólnotę, wspieramy się i szanujemy... A do Was, którzy polubiliście jego post mam pytanie, czy uważacie jego zachowanie za słuszne? Bo jeśli tak, to tracę wiarę w sens i misję wspierania młodych artystów... zwyczajnie po ludzku mi przykro."

## Analysis of the Stańkos' Claims in Light of Evidence:

# Lack of Contact and Blocking 
Both Andrzej and Krystyna Stańko claim that I did not try to contact them or that I was blocked. This is directly contradicted by my evidence, which shows that I sent a formal email to Andrzej Stańko just two hours before his deleted Facebook comment on May 19 [Source: last Stanko email 22 05 2025 Mail - Johnny Mazur - Outlook.pdf]. I never blocked his email or other communication channels. Moreover, Andrzej Stańko himself, in his email dated May 18, 2025, at 12:46 PM, directly refers to "yesterday's conversation," confirming continuity of communication and that his "resignation" was in writing, thereby providing evidence for my Facebook publication. This further refutes the claim that he could not contact me.

# Public Status of ORK and Fundacja
Both Stańkos publicly maintain that ORK is not a "municipal institution" and "does not have concert grants," claiming it is maintained solely by ticket sales. This is directly contradicted by official documents from the National Court Register (KRS) for Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska (KRS: 0000286430), which clearly indicate that the Fundacja has the status of a Public Benefit Organization (OPP) [Source: Odpis Aktualny KRS 0000286430.pdf, Page 1, Rubryka 1, Pole 5]. Public Benefit Organizations in Poland are entitled to receive public funds and grants, and their statutory objectives often include artistic and cultural activities.

"Black PR" and "Disseminating False Information": These counter-accusations are undermined by my systematic and documented reports to the prosecutor's office, which are based on collected evidence and are subject to formal proceedings. My action is an attempt to expose alleged irregularities, not baseless defamation.

"Symbolic Amount of 800 PLN": While Krystyna Stańko describes 800 PLN as a "symbolic amount," my reports detail that it was a financial threat that, in practice, could have reduced my fee to zero or resulted in a loss, especially for unnecessary 'sound technician' services.

## Financial Opacity and Alleged Misuse of Public Funds
A central pillar of this investigation is the alleged financial irregularities surrounding Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska and ORK.

# Contradictory Public Status
Andrzej Stańko publicly claimed that ORK is "maintained by ticket sales, not public money" and "is not an institution that has grants for concert organization" [Source: Deleted Facebook Comment, May 19, 2025, 11 AM]. However, official documents from the National Court Register (KRS) for Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska (KRS: 0000286430) clearly state that the Fundacja posiada status Organizacji Pożytku Publicznego (OPP) [Source: Odpis Aktualny KRS 0000286430.pdf, Page 1, Rubryka 1, Pole 5]. OPPs in Poland are legally eligible to receive public funds, grants, and tax deductions due to their public interest activities. This directly contradicts Mr. Stańko's public assertions.

# Suspicious Business Changes (STANJO)
My investigation revealed a drastic "makeover" of STANJO Andrzej Stańko's business registration (NIP: 5841511428) in the Central Register and Information on Economic Activity (CEIDG). Shortly after my first formal report to the prosecutor on May 22, 2025, the predominant PKD code was allegedly changed from artistic performance support (90.02.Z) to retail sale of motor vehicles (47.81.Z), and the business activity was suspended on June 1, 2025 [Source: Previous reports to prosecutors, CEIDG printouts from May 25 and June 3, 2025]. This sudden and radical shift, after two years of no changes, strongly suggests an attempt to conceal evidence or evade accountability related to the ongoing investigation.

# On-Site Documentation and Discrepancies
On June 6, 2025, I conducted an on-site visit to the registered address of STANJO (ul. Brzozowej 14, Lniska). My visit was documented with video footage, including a timestamped newspaper to verify the date [Source: video_2025-06-09_10-36-35.mp4]. A conversation with a neighbor at the address, also recorded, revealed no knowledge of any business activity taking place there [Source: NeighbourStanko.mp3, transcription_stanko_neighbour.txt]. This evidence strongly supports the suspicion that STANJO may be a fictitious business or a front for other activities.

# Questionable Artist Payments
Further financial irregularities have emerged. A bank transfer confirmation from Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska (account: 81 1020 1811 0000 0002 0125 1966) to a private musician's account (name removed for privacy & safety) for 1856 PLN on January 21, 2025, for "UMOWA 1/2025/ORK" has been obtained [Source: Bank Transfer Confirmation]. This amount was allegedly for two musicians, without individual contracts or a clear breakdown, with instructions to "dogadać się między sobą" (sort it out among yourselves) for payment distribution. Mathematical analysis shows that 1856 PLN is not divisible by the 50 PLN ticket price. Even when considering the overall payment to be a percentage of ticket sales (e.g., 80% of 2320 PLN, which is the 'cleanest' result), the resulting total is not a multiple of 50 PLN. This strongly suggests that either other priced tickets (e.g., VIP) were sold without transparency, or there's a more fundamental lack of clarity in compensation and potential undisclosed deductions, raising significant questions about financial transparency and fair payment to artists [Source: Janek Mazur's report to prosecutor, "Analiza matematyczna nieprawidłowości finansowych"].

Moreover, official Fundacja documents, publicly available, allegedly show artists performing at Fundacja events consistently listed as "unpaid labor," despite the institution's reported annual profits reaching millions of zlotys. This raises serious questions about the Fundacja's financial transparency and ethical treatment of artists.

## The Academic Connection: Conflict of Interest and Institutional Inaction
The allegations extend to the Academy of Music in Gdańsk, where I am a Master's student and Krystyna Stańko, Andrzej's wife, is a professor.

# Public Interference and Alleged Harassment:
Krystyna Stańko publicly commented on social media, making suggestive remarks that I believe were aimed at discrediting me and influencing my peers at the Academy. This alleged public interference, coupled with alleged threats and harassment (as detailed in my reports to the prosecutor under Art. 190a KK and Art. 216 KK), has created a hostile environment, leading to my fear of attending the Academy.

# Rector's Dismissive Stance and "Gaslighting" form of responses:
Despite formal reports and explicit concerns about my safety, the Academy's Rector, Prof. Ryszard Minkiewicz, has consistently denied the Academy's involvement, stating that the ORK concert was a "private event" and that the Academy "is not a party" to the dispute [Source: Rector's Email Response, May 27, 2025]. His subsequent communications have been characterized by an alleged pattern of "gaslighting," where he avoided addressing the core allegations of student abuse, shifted responsibility, and insisted on in-person meetings despite my documented fear and requests for written communication [Source: ALL-EMAILS-WITH-REKTOR.txt]. The timing of my leave of absence being granted "immediately and without warning" just after Andrzej Stańko's business suspension, followed by a return to "silence" after I used the official abuse reporting channel, raises serious questions about institutional transparency and potential attempts to quietly remove me.

# Bureaucratic Obstruction:
A glaring conflict of interest emerged when I was twice officially directed by the Gdańsk City Hall's Culture Bureau to report Andrzej Stańko to Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska, despite his official email being a.stanko@wspolnotagdanska.pl. When I escalated this conflict to the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, they issued a similar response, stating they lacked competence to resolve "unfair market practices" disputes and redirected me back to the Fundacja or civil courts. This bureaucratic loop suggests a systemic failure to address the core conflict of interest and proper oversight of Public Benefit Organizations. Consequently, I have escalated this matter to the Chairman of the Committee for Public Benefit, awaiting a response.

# Escalation to Violence: The Żukowo Incident
The most alarming incident occurred on June 6, 2025, at the location of Andrzej Stańko's registered business in Lniska, Żukowo. This incident demonstrates a dangerous escalation of behavior.

# Aggression, Threats, and Threatening Behaviour Witnessed by Police:
While I was waiting alone at a bus stop after documenting my visit to the STANJO address, Andrzej Stańko allegedly arrived in an "extremely aggressive and dangerous" manner. He drove recklessly, yelled brutal insults ("Ty skurwysynu jebany!"), and had to be physically restrained by uniformed police officers who had just arrived [Source: Janek Mazur's 6th Prosecutor Report, June 7, 2025].

# Threats at the Police Station:
The aggression continued at the Żukowo police station. Andrzej Stańko and his son, Mikołaj Stańko, continued to verbally abuse me ("chodź tu, ty ściero!"), physically threatening me, and attempting to record me. Uniformed officers were repeatedly forced to physically intervene to separate us. Crucially, these events were captured on the police station's monitoring system, providing objective and irrefutable evidence of their conduct [Source: Janek Mazur's 6th Prosecutor Report, June 7, 2025]. My subsequent panicked escape from the station and two emergency calls to 112 further underscore the real fear for my life and safety [Source: Janek Mazur's 6th Prosecutor Report - Part 3, June 9, 2025].

# Alleged False Police Report:
Following the Żukowo incident, Krystyna Stańko allegedly attempted to file a false police report against me of stalking, and from later investigation I have heard that she has been claiming that I was "screaming 'you've ruined my life!'" outside her house. This claim is directly contradicted by my documented movements, video evidence, and the presence and intervention of uniformed officers who witnessed the actual events unfold at the bus stop and police station, not outside the house [Source: Janek Mazur's report to prosecutor, "Próba fałszywego zgłoszenia (Zukowo, 7 czerwca 2025)"]. I have formally requested the prosecutor to verify the content of her phone call to expose this alleged lie to law enforcement. What's more is that the address is literally just a house, and treated as a family home quite obviously in their reaction to the incident. So what is 'STANJO' and what business has been going on there?

Potential Flight Risk:
The Stańkos have reportedly gone on a low-key "holiday" just a week after the Żukowo incident. This discreet departure, in light of the serious allegations and ongoing legal proceedings, raises concerns about a potential flight risk to evade further investigation or legal consequences.

## The Pursuit of Justice
I have systematically reported these incidents and allegations to multiple prosecutor's offices in Gdańsk (Gdańsk-Śródmieście, Gdańsk-Oliwa) and Kartuzy, ensuring that all available evidence is submitted. The consistent, next-business-day responses and acknowledgments from the prosecutor's office indicate that my case is being treated seriously and my submissions are actively processed. I have also appealed to the President of Gdańsk to bring attention to these serious institutional irregularities.

This is not merely a personal dispute; it is an attempt to expose alleged corruption, abuse of power, and systemic failures within institutions that should serve the public and nurture artistic talent. My objective is to uncover the truth, ensure accountability, and prevent others from experiencing similar traumatic situations. The pursuit of justice will continue.
