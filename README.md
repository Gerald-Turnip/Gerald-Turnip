## Introduction

**Sopot, Poland – June 18, 2025**:
This report details a series of disturbing events and alleged systemic irregularities within prominent cultural and academic institutions in Gdańsk, Poland. What began as a dispute over a concert has escalated into a comprehensive account of alleged financial impropriety, abuse of power, coercion, and attempts to silence a student and artist. If this was an innocent business with nothing to hide, I would have been ignored or kindly informed. Instead, I was met with aggression, hostility, and fabricated counter-accusations — all because I went to a publicly listed business address to verify its status. This exposé aims to shed light on practices that, if true, undermine the integrity of public benefit organizations and the artistic community in Gdańsk.

# The Report

*The genesis of this investigation lies in a planned concert at Oliwski Ratusz Kultury (ORK), a venue operating under the Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska. On May 19, 2025, after making the decision to cancel my scheduled performance, I decided to publicly post and protest the treatment. This decision was a direct consequence of an aggressive and threatening phone call received on May 16, 2025, from Andrzej Stańko, the ORK Coordinator of Scenic Events.*

***

### The Concert Controversy: Threats and Coercion

During this phone call, Mr. Stańko's demeanor was intensely aggressive and confrontational, right at the get-go, without even saying “Dzień dobry” at the beginning, and far, far beyond any professional boundaries. He was constantly shouting, constantly aggressive, and made literally no attempt to engage in a reasonable conversation regarding my scheduled concert. His aggression stemmed from the fact that I was scheduled to perform another concert in Sopot the day prior to the ORK event. The severity and unreasonableness of this conversation, despite the concert being seven weeks away and easily rescheduled (had a rational discussion taken place) were immensely shocking. My experience and documentation of this phone call (as this is the only thing that has not been recorded) is corroborated by messages I immediately sent to many other musicians in my circle that same evening, at the same time, asking the same questions, asking if they had also encountered similar aggressive behavior from Mr. Stańko, due to the extreme nature of the call. Most knew little, or weren’t the main musicians involved in a band project (i.e. - the handling of the money) but of those that did confirm, the only other reports about him I received were negative and he was ‘rude’, ‘opryskliwy’, and simply ‘not nice’. Though not as extreme as what I had encountered, a certain picture was definitely already formed.

Following this alarming phone call, and seeking a verifiable record of his demands, I **explicitly** asked Mr. Stańko to put his position in an **email**. To my amazement, *he complied*, sending an email on May 18, 2025, at 12:46 PM [Source: original stanko email threat Gmail - Johnny Mazur - Concert 28.06.2025.pdf]. This email, though somewhat lighter in tone, *still confirmed his aggressive demands and threats of financial penalties exceeding 800 PLN if I did not cancel the Sopot concert* all of which directly led to my public Facebook post on May 19, 2025. Had he not sent this damning email, none of these subsequent events would have transpired.

This exploitative demand for exclusivity, coupled with the threat of financial penalties, was not part of any prior agreement, nor were the conditions formally presented, and quite frankly was so utterly vile that I was shocked. In my life, I’ve dealt with difficult and even dangerous people — but I’ve rarely encountered the kind of unprovoked hostility I experienced in that call. Though he was only on the phone, the level of rage was so intense it felt as though he was shouting into my ear from across the table. My initial contact with ORK in November 2024 involved a general discussion with Ewa Labenz about available dates and a standard 80/20 ticket split for a 100-person venue, with further details to be discussed closer to the concert date. No formal contract was physically signed, though this email established a legally binding contract for the concert on June 28, 2025, and the email from Andzrej Stańko on May the 18th clearly depicts *different terms* agreed upon beforehand, and *financial threats* that highlight Andrzej Stańko's aggressive demands. Crucially, I allege that Andzrej Stańko, despite ORK's public-facing role, attempted to impose private, non-negotiable, and ***illegal*** terms.

Andrzej Stańko, attempted to unilaterally change terms previously agreed upon.

- Here's why, in clear terms under Polish law:

  - **A Contract Was Formed**: The email exchange between myself and Ewa Labenz from October 27, 2024, to November 7, 2024, established a legally binding contract for the concert on June 28, 2025. Polish law allows for contracts to be formed through clear offer and acceptance, even if not in a formal paper document. Ewa Labenz, as a coordinator for ORK, made an offer with specific terms (80/20 revenue split from ticket sales, ticket price range, hall capacity, date), and you clearly accepted these terms by confirming the date.

  - **Unilateral Attempt to Change Terms**: Andrzej Stańko's email on May 18, 2025, introduced new conditions and a different financial split (70/30 or 800 PLN flat fee for dual performances). This directly contradicts the 80/20 split already agreed upon in the initial, valid contract.

  - **Invalidity of Unilateral Change**: Under Polish law, a contract can only be changed with the mutual consent of both parties (**Article 77 § 1 Civil Code**). One party cannot simply change the terms on their own.

  - **Threat of Resignation**: Andrzej Stańko's statement, " *Brak odpowiedzi do wtorku 20.05 potraktuję jako Pana rezygnację z zagrania koncertu w ORK* " ( *Lack of response by Tuesday 20.05 will be treated as your resignation from playing the concert at ORK* ), is an attempt to impose a new condition on an existing agreement. Any silence in response to this unilateral demand does not automatically mean one agreed to the new terms or that one has resigned from the original, valid contract.

Therefore, from a legal standpoint in Poland, Andrzej Stańko's email, proposing terms contrary to the established contract and attempting to force a decision under threat of "resignation," appears to be an attempted breach of the existing agreement and an invalid unilateral modification of the contract.

## Initial Public Statement: The Catalyst

On May 19, 2025, I made a public statement on Facebook, announcing the cancellation of my concert and outlining the reasons behind my decision. This post served as the catalyst for the subsequent public responses and counter-allegations from the Stańkos, and initiated the formal reporting to various institutions.

- ### My Facebook Post (May 19, 2025, 09:05 AM)

"Mazur Janek
19 May at 09:05 · Shared with Public

> 🎻 KONCERT ODWOŁANY / CONCERT CANCELLED ❌
🇵🇱 Z przykrością odwołuję mój koncert w Oliwskim Ratuszu Kultury (ORK), zaplanowany na 28 czerwca.
Dlaczego? Ponieważ zostałem zagrożony karami finansowymi przekraczającymi 800 zł, jeśli nie odwołam innego koncertu — zaplanowanego dzień wcześniej w Sopocie.
Naprawdę.
Decyzja ta pochodzi od Andrzeja Stańko, Koordynatora Wydarzeń Scenicznych ORK — instytucji finansowanej publicznie, działającej w ramach Fundacji Wspólnota Gdańsk, która rzekomo wspiera kulturę.
Zażądał wyłączności. Nie z powodów artystycznych, tylko dlatego, że „oba miejsca są oddalone o 5 km”.
Zaproponował możliwość zagrania obu koncertów tylko jeśli zrzeknę się prawie całego dochodu z biletów.
💸 To nie jest współpraca. To szantaż.
To zachowanie nie ma miejsca w kulturze.
To nie tylko brak szacunku wobec mnie, ale też wobec młodych muzyków, którzy często grają recitale dyplomowe właśnie w tych salach.
Zgłosiłem ten incydent — wraz ze zrzutami ekranu — do wielu instytucji kultury, wydziałów miejskich i uczelni artystycznych.
Bo mam ZERO TOLERANCJI dla mobbingu, zastraszania i finansowego wymuszania w imię „współpracy”.
Wybieram uczciwość zamiast uległości.
I nie będę wspierał instytucji, które nadużywają swojej pozycji.

- ## Response and Counter-Allegations by the Stańkos
Following my initial public statement regarding the concert cancellation, both Andrzej Stańko and Krystyna Stańko issued public responses that contain claims directly contradicted by documented evidence.

 - ### *Krystyna Stańko's Facebook Post (Day after my Facebook post)*:
Krystyna Stańko, responding publicly to the situation, wrote: 

> *Drodzy, jak wiecie zawsze leży mi na sercu dobro młodych artystów. Niejednokrotnie razem z moim mężem Andrzej Stańko wspieraliśmy, pomagaliśmy, wiedząc, jak trudne jest życie muzyka. Robiliśmy to z dobrego serca... Niestety od dwóch dni jeden z młodych muzyków uprawia straszliwy czarny PR, nie wymienię jego nazwiska, bo posty krytykujące mojego męża na stronie tej osoby wreszcie mają zasięgi. Może właśnie o to chodzi, żeby zaistnieć? Gdy mój mąż chciał napisać swój komentarz i wyjaśnić sprawę, został przez niego zablokowany. Ów młody muzyk straszy prokuraturą, twierdzi, że powiadomił instytucje oraz media w mieście itp. Szkaluje dobre imię mojego męża i rozpowszechnia nieprawdziwe treści. Cóż, chciał zagrać dwa koncerty w oddalonych od siebie o 5 km miejscach w bardzo bliskim terminie, o czym mój mąż dowiedział się nie od niego, lecz z internetu. Aby nie odwoływać koncertu, na który sprzedało się bardzo mało biletów, Andrzej Stańko szukał rozwiązania, zaproponował wynajem sali z akustykiem, za symboliczną kwotę 800 zł (!). Czy to dużo? Z pewnością nie, w sumie miał prawo odwołać ten koncert wobec postawy muzyka, który nie poinformował organizatora o planie zagrania kolejnego koncertu tak blisko. Wbrew temu, co udostępnia muzyk, miejsce w którym pracuje mój mąż nie ma dotacji do koncertów i nie jest instytucją miejską. Jestem wstrząśnięta zachowaniem muzyka, w sumie ręce mi opadają, bo zawsze wierzyłam, że tworzymy jakąś wspólnotę, wspieramy się i szanujemy... A do Was, którzy polubiliście jego post mam pytanie, czy uważacie jego zachowanie za słuszne? Bo jeśli tak, to tracę wiarę w sens i misję wspierania młodych artystów... zwyczajnie po ludzku mi przykro.*

 - ### *Andrzej Stańko's Deleted Facebook Comment (May 19, 2025, 11 AM)*:
Andrzej Stańko publicly commented: 
> "Szanowny Panie, po pierwsze scena Oliwskiego Ratusza Kultury utrzymuje się z biletów, a nie z pieniędzy publicznych. Na Pana koncert sprzedało się 5 biletów! Nie poinformował nas Pan, że zaplanowany jest Pana kolejny koncert w odległości 5km! Dowiedziałem się o tym z internetu, a nie od Pana. Przypominam, że termin Pana koncertu został wpisany do naszego kalendarza 7.11.2024. Aby nie odwoływać koncertu zaproponowałem rozwiązanie, 800 zł, to koszt wynajmu sali z realizatorem dźwięku. Czy to dużo? Nie sądzę. Powinien Pan wiedzieć, że żaden klub, ani instytucja nie zgodzi się na granie 2 koncertów w tak bliskiej odległości w podobnym czasie. Proszę nie siać dezinformacji i nie nastawiać wrogo artystów i publiczności! Używanie takich słów jak: „mobbing, wrogość, ultimatum" są w te sytuacji bezpodstawne. Przykro również, że nie spróbował Pan się ze mną skontaktować i porozmawiać. Oliwski Ratusz Kultury w ramach swojego programu zaprasza artystów także mniej znanych, ale warunek jest jeden, ponieważ nie jest instytucją, która ma dotację na organizację koncertów, muszą się one samofinansować, a przynajmniej nie przynosić strat. Również po to, żeby to miejsce mogło nadal służyć artystom."

## Analysis of the Stańkos' Claims in Light of Evidence:

- ##Manipulative Use of Anonymity and Implicit Identification:
Krystyna Stańko explicitly states, "nie wymienię jego nazwiska..." ("I will not mention his name..."). This is a common tactic to try and avoid legal responsibility for defamation. However, her subsequent phrasing unequivocally identifies me. She refers to:

  -"jeden z młodych muzyków" (one of the young musicians)

  -"posty krytykujące mojego męża" (posts criticizing my husband)

  -"posty, które wreszcie mają zasięgi" (posts that are finally gaining reach)

  -"straszy prokuraturą, twierdzi, że powiadomił instytucje oraz media w mieście" (threatens with the prosecutor's office, claims to have informed institutions and media in the city).
All these details directly mirror my public actions and original Facebook post. Any reasonable person reading both posts would easily deduce I am the subject. This deliberate choice not to name me, despite clearly identifying me, highlights her awareness of potential legal repercussions if her claims were false. If she were confident in her accusations, there would be no reason to shy away from naming me directly. This tactic immediately stuck out as odd and unprompted, prompting my own deeper investigation. This further reveals a manipulative strategy to undermine my credibility while attempting to maintain deniability.

- ### Lack of Contact and Blocking:
Both Andrzej and Krystyna Stańko claim that I did not try to contact them or that I was blocked. This is directly contradicted by my evidence, which shows that I sent a formal email to Andrzej Stańko just two hours before his deleted Facebook comment on May 19 [Source:]. I never blocked his email or other communication channels. Moreover, Andrzej Stańko himself, in his email dated May 18, 2025, at 12:46 PM, directly refers to "yesterday's conversation", confirming continuity of communication and that his "rezygnacja" (resignation) was in writing, thereby providing evidence for my Facebook publication. This further refutes the claim that he could not contact me.

- ### Public Status of ORK and Fundacja:
Both Stańkos publicly maintain that ORK is not a "municipal institution" and "does not have concert grants", claiming it is maintained solely by ticket sales. This is directly contradicted by official documents from the National Court Register (KRS) for Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska (KRS: 0000286430), which clearly indicate that the Fundacja has the status of a Public Benefit Organization (OPP) [Source: Odpis Aktualny KRS 0000286430.pdf, Page 1, Rubryka 1, Pole 5]. Public Benefit Organizations in Poland are entitled to receive public funds and grants, and their statutory objectives often include artistic and cultural activities.

- ### "Black PR" and "Disseminating False Information": 
These counter-accusations are undermined by my systematic and documented reports to the prosecutor's office, which are based on collected evidence and are subject to formal proceedings. My action is an attempt to expose alleged irregularities, not baseless defamation.

"Symbolic Amount of 800 PLN": While Krystyna Stańko describes 800 PLN as a "symbolic amount", my reports, and the *literal email from Andzrej himself* detail that it was a financial threat that, in practice, could have reduced my fee to zero or caused a loss, especially for unnecessary services.

- ### Unprompted Denial of Public Funding (Krystyna Stańko): 
Krystyna Stańko's explicit denial of public funding for ORK ("Wbrew temu, co udostępnia muzyk, miejsce w którym pracuje mój mąż nie ma dotacji do koncertów i nie jest instytucją miejską." - "Despite what the musician is sharing, the place where my husband works does not have concert grants and is not a municipal institution.") is particularly telling. This statement was made without me having publicly addressed their funding at that point, suggesting a pre-emptive attempt to mislead the public about a known point of vulnerability. This immediately struck me as odd and out of place, as my initial Facebook post was centered on Andrzej's aggressive behavior, not the venue's funding structure. The fact that she chose to defend this specific point, unprompted, made me suspicious. This then led me to investigate further, where I discovered the easily verifiable lie about their Public Benefit Organization status, clearly stated in bold letters on their website: "Jesteśmy Organizacją Pożytku Publicznego. Wesprzyj edukację najmłodszych Gdańszczan przekazując 1,5% podatku. KRS 0000286430". This incident fundamentally highlights a pattern of deliberate misinformation and indicates the Stańkos' heightened sensitivity to financial scrutiny, even when not directly prompted by my initial public complaints, and despite having access to the same documented information I do.

# Financial Opacity and Alleged Misuse of Public Funds
A central pillar of this investigation is the alleged financial irregularities surrounding Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska and ORK.

- ### Contradictory Public Status:
Andrzej Stańko publicly claimed that ORK is "maintained by ticket sales, not public money" and "is not an institution that has grants for concert organization" [Source: Deleted Facebook Comment, May 19, 2025, 11 AM]. However, official documents from the National Court Register (KRS) for Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska (KRS: 0000286430) clearly state that the Fundacja posiada status Organizacji Pożytku Publicznego (OPP) [Source: Odpis Aktualny KRS 0000286430.pdf, Page 1, Rubryka 1, Pole 5]. OPPs in Poland are legally eligible to receive public funds, grants, and tax deductions due to their public interest activities. This directly contradicts Mr. Stańko's public assertions.

- ### Questionable Artist Payments and Alleged Financial Misconduct:
Further financial irregularities have emerged. A bank transfer confirmation from Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska (account: 81 1020 1811 0000 0002 0125 1966) to a private musician's account *(name removed for privacy & safety)* for 1856 PLN on *(date removed for privacy & safety)* has been obtained [Source: Bank Transfer Confirmation,]. This amount was allegedly for two musicians, without individual contracts or a clear breakdown, with instructions to "dogadać się między sobą" (sort it out among yourselves) for payment distribution. Mathematical analysis shows that 1856 PLN is not divisible by the 50 PLN ticket price. Even when considering the overall payment to be a percentage of ticket sales (e.g., 80% of 2320 PLN, which is the 'cleanest' result), the resulting total is not a multiple of 50 PLN. This strongly suggests that either other priced tickets (e.g., VIP) were sold without transparency, or there's a more fundamental lack of clarity in compensation and potential undisclosed deductions, raising significant questions about financial transparency and fair payment to artists [Source: Janek Mazur's report to prosecutor, "Analiza matematyczna nieprawidłowości finansowych"].

Moreover, official Fundacja documents, publicly available, allegedly show artists performing at Fundacja events consistently listed as "unpaid labor," despite the institution's reported annual profits reaching millions of zlotys. This raises serious questions about the Fundacja's financial transparency and ethical treatment of artists.

- ### The Theory of Cultural Grant Embezzlement:
The pattern of alleged financial discrepancies suggests a potential scheme of "soft corruption" or embezzlement. Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska, as an OPP, is eligible for and likely applies for public cultural grants with itemized budgets for performers, production costs, and staff. However, the available evidence indicates a discrepancy in how artists are reportedly paid (under the table, less than declared, or not at all), often under the guise of "exposure" or hidden fees. The surplus cash from these funds not paid to artists or used as claimed could potentially be diverted into a private business, such as the co-marital operation in Lniska, used to launder or hide funds.

- If this theory proves true, it could constitute serious offenses under Polish law, including:

  - **art. 190§1 kk – Criminal threat**
  - **art. 216§1 kk – Insult / Defamation**
  - **art. 286§1 kk – Fraud**
  - **art. 191 kk – Coercion / Extortion**
  - **art. 231§1 kk – Abuse of power by a public official**
- and *more...*

# The Impossible Equation: *Where Did the Millions Come From?*
Analysis of Wspólnota Gdańska's reported income (e.g., 3,362,246.05 PLN total income in 2023, with only ~299,200 PLN from city grants and 4,034.44 PLN from 1.5% PIT donations) reveals a significant gap of over 1 million PLN between public funds and reported earnings that remains unexplained. If they did not secure major national or EU grants, list corporate donors, show transparent attendance revenue, or report large private income sources, then the source of these millions is highly suspicious. Despite significant payroll expenditures (over 1.5M PLN in wages paid to 127 people in 2023), artists reportedly remain unpaid, suggesting money flows but not to the cultural value creators. This points towards undeclared income or shadow operations, potentially through means such as:

- *Shadow contracting via STANJO (now suspended).*
- *Commercial use of publicly funded cultural infrastructure (weddings, rentals, film shoots) disguised as "community events."*
- *Donation laundering through non-transparent sources.*
- *"Ghost events" or fabricated program results to justify income.*
- *ORK's Empty Calendar: A "Clown Nose of a Red Flag"*

Beyond specific incidents, a significant red flag regarding ORK's operational stability is the apparent complete lack of scheduled events after July 11, 2025. Mid-July marks the prime season for cultural events in Poland, and a venue priding itself on seasonal programming having no bookings after this period is highly unusual. This suggests several unflattering possibilities:

- *Funding freeze*: A whisper of financial misconduct or an audit could have led to a halt in bookings.
- *Internal panic*: Uncertainty about maintaining operations might lead them to avoid future obligations.
- *Quiet disappearance preparation*: A "fade into the mist" strategy, concluding public commitments and then ceasing to respond.
- *Potential blacklisting*: Word spreading among artists or institutions could be causing a decline in collaboration.

The absence of future events when the calendar should be bustling is not business as usual; it points to either severe damage control or a ticking clock on their operations.

## The Academic Connection: Conflict of Interest and Institutional Inaction
The allegations extends to the Academy of Music in Gdańsk, where I am a Master's student and Krystyna Stańko, Andrzej's wife, is a professor.

- ### Public Interference and Alleged Harassment & Defamation:
Krystyna Stańko publicly commented on social media, making suggestive remarks that I believe were aimed at discrediting me and influencing my peers at the Academy. She has actively used her position at the Academy to do her utmost 'to destroy' me. The effect of this has been felt, documented, reported to prosecutors, and I am formally pressing charges. This alleged public interference, coupled with alleged threats and harassment (as detailed in my reports to the prosecutor under Art. 190a KK and Art. 216 KK), has created a hostile environment, leading to my fear of attending the Academy.

- ### Rector Ryszard Minkiewicz and his Denial & Dismissive Stance:
Despite formal reports and explicit concerns about my safety, the Academy's Rector, Prof. Ryszard Minkiewicz, has consistently denied the Academy's involvement, stating that the ORK concert was a "private event" and that the Academy "is not a party" to the dispute [Source: Rector's Email Response, May 27, 2025]. His subsequent communications have been characterized by a pattern of written gaslighting, where he avoided addressing the core allegations of student abuse mutlipel times, shifted responsibility, and insisted on in-person meetings despite my documented fear and requests for written communication [Source: ALL-EMAILS-WITH-REKTOR.txt]. The timing of my leave of absence being suddenly offered and granted *immediately and with all other channels within the Academy of Music still not responding* just after Andrzej Stańko's business suspension, followed by the return to silence after I used the official abuse reporting channel, raises serious questions about institutional transparency and potential attempts to quietly remove me.

- ### Bureaucratic Obstruction and Alleged Complicity:
A glaring conflict of interest emerged when I was twice officially directed by the Gdańsk City Hall's Culture Bureau to report Andrzej Stańko to Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska, despite his official email being a.stanko@wspolnotagdanska.pl. When I escalated this conflict to the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, they issued a similar response, stating they lacked competence to resolve "unfair market practices" disputes and redirected me back to the Fundacja or civil courts. This bureaucratic loop suggests a systemic failure to address the core conflict of interest and proper oversight of Public Benefit Organizations. Consequently, I have escalated this matter to the Chairman of the Committee for Public Benefit, awaiting a response.

A Web of Familial Connections: Allegations of Nepotism within Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska
A thorough examination of Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska's personnel reveals a deeply entrenched pattern of recurring surnames in key positions, strongly suggesting systemic nepotism. This structure concentrates power within a limited number of families, raising serious questions about transparency, accountability, and potential conflicts of interest in the management of a Public Benefit Organization that handles public funds.

Key familial clusters identified:

### The Stelmasiewicz Family:

- **Andrzej Stelmasiewicz**: Founder of Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska, and notably, a current City Councilor (Radny Miasta Gdańska).

- **Ewa Stelmasiewicz-Wegnerowska**: President of the Board of Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska (likely Andrzej Stelmasiewicz's daughter, as previously indicated).

**Implication**: This places the founder and the highest executive position within the same family, directly linking the foundation to the city's political structure. This connection raises suspicions of potential deep corruption within the Gdańsk city government, as it suggests a high-level conflict of interest that could influence funding and oversight. Public controversies surrounding Andrzej Stelmasiewicz, including accusations of unethically receiving a "Donor of the Year" award and channeling his councilor diets to entities connected to city authorities (including Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska), further underscore these concerns.

### The Leśniewski Family:

- **Jolanta Leśniewska**: Director of the Fundacja.

- **Dariusz Leśniewski**: Technical Specialist for the Fundacja. (Highly likely to be related to Jolanta).

### The Majchrzakowski Family:

- **Magdalena Majchrzakowska**: Cultural Animator for the Fundacja.

- **Filip Majchrzakowski**: Manager of the Ratusz Bed & Breakfast hostel (part of the Fundacja's operations). (Highly likely to be related to Magdalena).

### The Stańko Family:

- **Andrzej Stańko**: Coordinator of Scenic Events (ORK).

- **Krystyna Stańko**: Professor at the Academy of Music, Andrzej's wife. (This connection is central to the initial concert controversy and the academic conflict of interest).

- **Mikołaj Stańko**: Andrzej and Krystyna's son, involved in the Żukowo incident.

This pervasive pattern of familial connections across management, technical roles, accounting, and even related businesses within the Fundacja creates a framework ripe for potential abuse of power and reduced external scrutiny. It transforms the administrative run-around I experienced into a more sinister suggestion of a system designed to resist accountability.

The complete puzzle suggests that ORK operates through Fundacja Wspólnota Gdańska, a public benefit foundation officially eligible for – and almost certainly receiving – public cultural grants. Meanwhile, performers (including students) are allegedly denied contracts, threatened with penalties, and coerced into playing under exploitative terms, potentially not being paid properly at all. These concerts might be "double-funded": on paper via public grant money, and in practice, with students being charged or made to play for "exposure." Krystyna Stańko, as an Academy professor, allegedly recruits students to perform, directs them to her husband's concerts, and maintains an unchecked conflict of interest. The Rector, despite being informed of abuse and conflict of interest, allegedly ignored or deflected all references, even inviting me onto campus despite my expressed fear. His repeated declarations of the Academy being "not a party" now appear to be a strategic legal shield. This raises questions about whether the Academy gains prestige without paying by outsourcing events to ORK, potentially through informal partnerships, and whether the institution is protecting faculty to avoid reputational damage. The Rector's "mantra" of denial, especially given the silence on the abuse, makes them look evasive and potentially complicit.

The Foundation's own Statut (Bylaws) state its statutory goals include cultural education for young residents of Gdańsk and supporting artistic activities, including promoting and organizing volunteer work. This directly contradicts the coercive tactics, threats, and manipulated finances alleged, implying violations of their legal and ethical mission. If proven, this could lead to their OPP status being revoked.

# The Żukowo Incident & Investigation of *STANJO*
The most alarming incident occurred on June 6, 2025, at the location of Andrzej Stańko's registered business in Lniska, Żukowo. This incident demonstrates a dangerous escalation of behavior and is a huge pillar in the case.
- Link to CEIDG [STANJO - Centralna Ewidencja i Informacja o Działalności Gospodarczej Rzeczypospolitej](https://www.biznes.gov.pl/pl/wyszukiwarka-firm/wpis/ceidg/3B09072E-B5C5-4F73-AA49-3CC64BE4035F)
- Officially registered address according to ***public, governmental records***:
  - ul. Brzozowa 14, 83-330 Lniska, pow. kartuski, gm. Żukowo, woj. POMORSKIE, Polska

- ### Suspicious Business Changes to *STANJO*:
My investigation revealed a drastic "makeover" of STANJO Andrzej Stańko's business registration (NIP: 5841511428) in the Central Register and Information on Economic Activity (CEIDG). The business appears to be a marital co-ownership, seemingly existing primarily on paper without a clear public presence beyond its CEIDG listing. Shortly after my first formal report to the prosecutor on May 22, 2025, the predominant PKD code was allegedly changed from artistic performance support (90.02.Z) to retail sale of motor vehicles (47.81.Z), and the business activity was suspended on June 1, 2025 [Source: Previous reports to prosecutors, CEIDG printouts from May 25 and June 3, 2025]. This sudden and radical shift, after two years of no changes, strongly suggests an attempt to conceal evidence or evade accountability related to the ongoing investigation.

- ### Aggression Witnessed by Police:
On June 6, 2025, I conducted an on-site visit to the official address of the "STANJO Andrzej Stańko" business, located at ul. Brzozowej 14, 83-330 Lniska. This visit was prompted by suspicious changes to its business profile (from artistic services to motorcycle engine services, occurring on June 1), as well as the simultaneous suspension of its business activity. ***I filmed my entire time spent in the vicinity of the property.***

A statement I detailed for the prosecutor in one of my reports is that after leaving the vicinity of the property at approximately 19:45-19:50, I walked directly to the nearby bus stop. At around 20:45, police arrived directly at the bus stop where I was alone. Within one minute, Andrzej Stańko arrived, followed soon after by Krystyna and her son, suggesting coordinated tracking - i.e they were driving up and down that road and watching me until the police were there so they could try to entrap me. At no point did I observe anyone watching from the windows or inside the house, indicating my presence was likely unknown until a neighbor's alert. This undercuts claims of me being threatening or lingering. My timeline of formal reports (starting May 22nd) is consistent, while Krystyna Stańko's later police filings appear reactive and an attempt to weaponize legal ambiguity. Besides, *I was the only calm person and the police treated me very well,* and I am glad they were there to help me.

Just moments after police officers observed and approached me (around 8:45 PM) – likely informed by a neighbor who relayed information to the Stańko family – Andrzej Stańko appeared on site in an extremely aggressive and dangerous manner. He drove into the bus bay against traffic, at high speed, nearly driving onto the pavement where I stood. He exited his car, yelling brutal insults ("Ty skurwysynu jebany!" - "You fucking bastard!"), and had to be physically restrained by uniformed police officers who had just arrived [Source: Janek Mazur's 6th Prosecutor Report, June 7, 2025]. The officers present were visibly concerned by his level of aggression and unpredictability; one even commented during transport to the police station: "the way this guy drove in was unbelievable."

- ### Threats at the Police Station:
Shortly after, Krystyna Stańko and their son also arrived. Krystyna attempted to approach me despite my repeated requests for no contact, necessitating police intervention. Ms. Stańko declared her intention to file a "harassment" report against me, despite my having no contact with her, no access to her number, and her accounts being blocked on all platforms. At the Żukowo police station, I cooperated fully. Officers documented my visit to the address due to information in the Central Register and Information on Economic Activity of the Republic of Poland and my conversation with a neighbor. The prosecutor's case number was added to this report.

Upon leaving the station, Andrzej Stańko waited in the reception area, and his son stood by the door. I repeatedly told officers I was afraid to leave; Andrzej attempted to record me with his phone, requiring an officer to intervene and prohibit further recording. When I stepped outside, Mikołaj Stańko began shouting at me, including "chodź tu, ty ściero!" ("come here, you rag!"), and physically positioned himself in front of me in a ready-to-attack stance, forcing officers to intervene again. I retreated inside, but Andrzej Stańko remained aggressive, snarling "no bój się kurwa, bój się" ("be afraid, goddammit, be afraid") and lunged towards me, placing himself directly in front of me, between the police station's two entrance doors. All of this occurred in plain sight of officers and is recorded on the Żukowo police station's monitoring system.

When officers positioned themselves between me and the Stańkos, I was so terrified that I fled the station in a panic. Fearing pursuit or being run over, I chose not to wait for the train (the platform is small, dimly lit, and lacks visible surveillance), instead running into a nearby Żabka at ul. Książąt Pomorskich 2f around 10:30 PM. Employees noted my state of extreme stress and breathlessness—I could barely speak due to shock. This too was registered on their surveillance.

Out of fear that Andrzej or Mikołaj would follow or try to hit me, I took a taxi to Pępowo Kartuskie—the only nearby train station outside Żukowo. The driver even asked, "Why Pępowo?", but I was too panicked to explain. Upon arrival, I hid behind a bus shelter and made two emergency calls (which are registered), stating I feared for my life and didn't know if the Stańkos had been detained or released. I remained hidden, watching for anyone entering the parking lot.

- ### Alleged False Police Report:
Following the Żukowo incident, Krystyna Stańko allegedly attempted to file a false police report against me of 'stalking', I have heard she was claiming I was "screaming 'you've ruined my life!'" outside her house. Luckily, I recorded my entire time and visit to the STANJO business. This potential claim of hers is directly contradicted by my documented movements, video evidence, and the presence and intervention of uniformed officers who witnessed the actual events unfold at the bus stop and police station, not outside the house [Source: Janek Mazur's report to prosecutor, "Próba fałszywego zgłoszenia (Zukowo, 7 czerwca 2025)"]. I have formally requested the prosecutor to verify the content of her phone call to expose this alleged lie to law enforcement.

# The Pursuit of Justice
I have systematically reported these incidents and allegations to multiple prosecutor's offices in Gdańsk (Gdańsk-Śródmieście, Gdańsk-Oliwa) and Kartuzy, ensuring that all available evidence is submitted. The consistent, next-business-day responses and acknowledgments from the prosecutor's office indicate that my case is being treated seriously and my submissions are actively processed. I have also appealed to the President of Gdańsk to bring attention to these serious institutional irregularities.

This is not merely a personal dispute; it is an attempt to expose alleged corruption, abuse of power, and systemic failures within institutions that should serve the public and nurture artistic talent. My objective is to uncover the truth, ensure accountability, and prevent others from experiencing similar traumatic situations. The pursuit of justice will continue.

#### A Striking Contrast: Professionalism vs. Chaos ####
In stark contrast to the aggression and alleged coercion I have faced from ORK and Andrzej Stańko, I recently experienced how easily similar logistical concerns can be resolved with some manners and a bit of professionalism. In a separate instance with another venue, I raised concerns about ticket price deductions and technician costs in one polite email. The venue responded respectfully, offering a reasonable compromise, and an mutually beneficial agreement was reached within just over an hour. 

*One hour*
*One email each*
*Done.*

This incident involved no threats, no gaslighting, no fabricated contracts, no prosecutors, no police, and no destroyed reputations. It highlights that the current scandal was entirely avoidable, had a professional approach been taken from the outset.

## 💬 Final Note

This is not just my story — this is a systemic problem.  
*And it ends here.*
